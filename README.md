# RL-an-Introduction-notes
My earlier notes were written by hand with GoodNotes, so I might miss some information in those notes. Later I change to using LaTex which allows directly import the screen shots to illustrate examples more conveniently. Sometimes I will write down my understanding or add more information in the form of *Remark*. 

### Upcoming notes: Ch9, Ch10

The meeting record is available in the [study group](https://sites.google.com/view/sntung/study-group?authuser=0) held by Prof. Tung.
