# RL an Introduction notes
My earlier notes were written by hand with GoodNotes, so I might miss some information in those notes. Later I change to using LaTex which allows directly import the screen shots to illustrate examples more conveniently. Sometimes I will write down my understanding or add more information in the terms of *Remark*. 

### Upcoming notes: Ch12, Ch13
Ch11 introduces the challenges and difficulties of off-policy function approximation, including the divergence and stabililty. There's no algorithm provided in this chapter. Reader who wants studies these problems could check the textbook.

The meeting record is available in the [study group](https://sites.google.com/view/sntung/study-group?authuser=0) held by Prof. Tung.
