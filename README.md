# RL an Introduction notes
My earlier notes were written by hand with GoodNotes, so I might miss some information in those notes. Later I change to using LaTex which allows directly import the screen shots to illustrate examples more conveniently. Sometimes I will write down my understanding or add more information in the terms of *Remark*. 

### Upcoming notes: Ch13
Ch11 introduces the challenges and difficulties of off-policy function approximation, including the divergence and stabililty of off-policy methods. There's no algorithm provided in this chapter, which is the reason I skipped this chapter. Readers who wants studies these problems could check the textbook. As for Ch12, my focus are the ideas and construction of $\lambda$-return algorithms, so I skipped some sections that are not highly related to my interest.

The meeting record is available in the [study group](https://sites.google.com/view/sntung/study-group?authuser=0) held by Prof. Tung.
